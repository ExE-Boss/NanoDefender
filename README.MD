## Report a problem

Before opening an issue, **always** check if there is already another issue about your problem. 

The version of uBlock Origin that Nano Adblocker uses can be found in About section of Nano Dashboard. I am aware 
that Nano Adblocker is different, but when it comes to filters, 99% of the time things work the same. If you have 
been told by contributors at uAssets that your issue could not be reproduced, **ping @jspenguin2017** or report it 
again to [NanoFilters](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters). 

Be sure to check if you have proper **regional filters** activated. 

For hard anti-adblock (allow ads or leave type), missed ads, and popup, report to 
[uAssets](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets). 

For any other filter issues, report to [NanoFilters](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoFilters). 

For bugs, suggestions, and questions, report to [NanoCore](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoCore).
