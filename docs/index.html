        <p>Every browser has its own problems, some solutions in Nano Defender only work in one browser and there is nothing I can do about that.</p>
        <p>The onbeforescriptexecute event polyfill still does not work on Firefox and it looks like it is not getting fixed anytime soon, so some rules in Nano Defender will only work on Chromium but not Firefox. Firefox is the first browser to get that event and is also the first one to lose it, how sad.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem on Firefox right now is Content Security Policy, but thankfully that is getting fixed soon.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, thanks of some extra APIs that Firefox has, some rules only work on Firefox but not Chromium, I guess unless you are willing to jump between the two browsers, you cannot have the best of both worlds.</p>
